## Architecture Overview

The project follows a component-based Next.js App Router architecture.

- App routes handle page-level rendering.
- Feature components handle reusable UI and interactions.
- Mock data layer simulates salary records.
- URL query parameters maintain filter state.
- Server components handle data processing.
- Client components handle interactive UI.


---

## Trade-off Decisions

- Used mock salary data instead of an external API because the task focuses on frontend implementation and UI behavior.
- Used URL query parameters for filters because it makes filtered pages shareable and preserves application state.
- Used client components only where interactivity was required, keeping other pages server-rendered for better performance.
- Calculated median compensation dynamically instead of storing derived values to keep the data consistent.
